# Web_Design_UI
This is a repository of HTML,JS,Bootstrap,JQuery practise (Academic/Voluntary)

##Info :
###Assignment 1 :  
Create an HTML pages as given in the Book (Basic HTML Tags)

###Assignment 2 : 
It has following parts
####PART 1. Read the following chapters (Beginning HTML)
  Chapter 3: Images and Objects
  Chapter 4: Tables
  Chapter 5: Forms
  Chapter 6: Frames

####PART 2. 
Do all the exercises at the end of these chapters

####PART 3. 
Using tables (I know tables should not be used to create layouts) create http://www.stanford.edu website (try to create a similar layout which doesn't need to be exactly the same as the official website. You could ignore animations, just use an image instead of the animation, and ignore the sub-menus; just use the top-level menu items to make it simpler), and upload to COE. Just provide the link of the site when submitting.

####PART 4. 
Create a personal website that uses frames (I know frames are no longer used). You could use a menu in one frame, and content in the other frame. Upload your site to COE servers, and provide the link of the site when submitting.

####PART 5. 
Convert the Following PDF Form to HTML Form.
HTML Form doesn't need to be 100% identical to the PDF form. Design the form the way you like; you could change the layout as you wish. This would be a web-based form to be submitted via online, so it may be different from the paper form.
For example, in the paper-based form, there is a table to write some information, but in the web-based form user cannot write into the table cells; a form element needs to be used. Upload your site to COE servers, and provide the link of the site when submitting.
