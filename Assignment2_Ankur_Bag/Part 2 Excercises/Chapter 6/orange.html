    <td><p>The fruit I chose to write about is an orange.   This is my favorite fruit because they are flavorful, sweet, and juicy.   In this paper I will describe to you the five senses of an orange. I will distinguish what an orange looks like, what it tastes like, how it smells, how it feels, and what kinds of sounds it make.
      An orange is round and shaped like a circle. They get their character and distinctive look from the dimple away from the stem end. The bottom end of the orange resembles a human navel. The color of the orange can vary from just orange to a mixture of orange and yellow, or orange with a hint of green. It has a relatively smooth, but irregular exterior. If you look closely, it has little small bumps on the outside of it. The peeling of the orange can be very thin and easy to peel, or thick. When you peel it, the inner side of the skin, called pith, gets on your hands from the orange layer protecting the fruit. Inside, there is a white layer past the orange layer, which is thicker in some oranges, but thinner on others. When you get to the center, the orange is in slices, and is packed with vitamin C. The orange slices themselves are protected by a layer of soft skin. Most oranges are small to medium sized, with little to no seeds in them. </p></td>
