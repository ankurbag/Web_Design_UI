CSS works by allowing you to associaterules with the elements that appear in a web page. These rules
govern how the content of those elements should be rendered. Figure 7 - 1 shows you an example of a
CSS rule, which is made up of two parts:
<ul >
  <li>The selector , which indicates which element or elements the declaration applies to (if it applies to
more than one element, you can have a comma - separated list of several elements)</li>
      <li> The declaration , which sets out how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled</li></ul>
<h3><a name="background" > Background Properties </a></h3>
