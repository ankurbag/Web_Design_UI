        <p>Welcome to example cafe. We will be developing this site throughout the book</p>
        <h2>A community cafe serving home cooked, locally sourced, organic food</h2>
        <p>With stunning views of the ocean, Example Cafe offers the perfect
            environment to unwind and recharge the batteries.</p>
        <p>Our menu offers a wide range of breakfasts, brunches and lunches,
            including a range of vegetarian options.</p>
        <p>Whether you sip on a fresh, hot coffee or a cooling smoothie, you
            never need to feel rushed - relax with friends or just watch
            the world go by.</p>
        <h2>This weekend's special brunch</h2>
        <p>This weekend, our season of special brunches continues with scrambled egg
            on an English muffin. Not for the faint-hearted, the secret to these eggs is
            that they are made with half cream and cooked in butter, with no more than
            four eggs in the pan at a time.</p>
