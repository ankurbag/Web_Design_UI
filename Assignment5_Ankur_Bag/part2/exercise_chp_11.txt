2. The offset properties left,right,top and bottom are used for positioning or adjusting the elements predominantly in the the relative positioning.

4.If any child element is positioned absolute within a relative positioned element, point of reference for absolute positioned element is the parent element.

5.Elements with a fixed position are always positioned relative to the viewport, regardless of whether they are contained in an element with relative or absolute positioning applied.Thus for an element with fixed position within a relatively positioned parent should be according to the viewport of the browser.

6.An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.So the last element will be stacked as the latest element.
